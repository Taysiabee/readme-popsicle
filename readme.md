# How to use my damn Popsicle() plugin!

## 1. Start by making a popsicle function.

A) With this function you're going to use an argument of **options**. (incase late you'd like to add more)

**Inside** this function create the element(**document.createElement**) wham with the argument of **div** to make **wham** an actual div.
Now since wham is now a div you can begin styling in javascript. That's right, **IN JAVASCRIPT.**

**EX: wham.style.whateverstyle**
	
After you have styled your div, you might wanna add some text inside of it. You do so by using innerHTML. 
**wham.innerHTML = options**

B) To actually  place this new wham div in the **document** of the **body**, you must use **appendChild** with the argument of wham. 

**document.body.appendchild(wham)


### 2. Make a button

make a variable, name it button and create it using **createElement("button")**
